# How to Use This Repo

1. Follow the **12 Clans** as chapters in your learning.
2. Watch the **YouTube channels** for each topic.
3. Practice implementing microservices, caching, APIs, messaging queues, and database sharding.
4. Use small projects like Chat App, URL Shortener, or Social Feed to apply concepts.
5. Refer to resources for **deep dives** and real-world production patterns.
6. Document each system you design and the trade-offs you considered.
